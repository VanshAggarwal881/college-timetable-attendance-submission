# college-timetable-attendance-submission
A college timetable of a class to submit the attendance online according to the current day with several restrictrions for safety and integrity.
this code is given only for showing the woriking and it is part of an another project. After running this code on the system it will show a gui window containing a timetable with several subjects as buttons. Those buttons are clickable as the are defined to submit the attendance, but there are some restrictions added there. As soon as a student or user runs the code , whole gui window appears but only those subject buttons are enabled which are gonna covered up by the teacher the current day (for example if today is wednesday, then only the subject buttons of wednesday will be enabled so that no student would be allowed to submit his attendance of all the days in one go.)
But there are some faults still there , all the buttons of the current day are opened every time there is no such restrictions of timing in the timetable, i tried to implement it but failed...
